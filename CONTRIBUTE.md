## Adding new features
Feel free to open a new issue (enhancement). I am sure we can use a lot of your great ideas! 

# Beta testing
Since this project heavily relies on browsers, beta testing can be proved a life saver. Trying the project on different browsers, operating systems and hardware and report back any issues
can help us identify many bugs!
